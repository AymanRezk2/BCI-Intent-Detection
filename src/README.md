- `features.py` â†’ Feature extraction (spectrograms, covariance matrices).
- `models/` â†’ Implementations of deep learning and signal processing models:
  - `eegnet.py` â†’ EEGNet CNN implementation.
  - `transformer.py` â†’ Transformer-based classifier for EEG.
  - `riemannian.py` â†’ Riemannian geometry + tangent space methods.
